# Documentation and Usability Course

This is a bookdown based course to cover the basics of creating documentation and tutorials to maximize the usability of ITCR tools.

This course is a part of an [ITCR training series](https://www.itcrtraining.org/) and was in part created from [this github template](https://github.com/jhudsl/DaSL_Course_Template_Bookdown).

You can see the [rendered course material here](https://jhudatascience.org/Documentation_and_Usability/introduction.html) or [on Leanpub here](https://leanpub.com/universities/courses/jhu/documentation_and_usability).

This course guides you on how to make a nice documentation website using [this handy template](https://github.com/jhudsl/template-documentation) and its associated checklists!
