## Learning Objectives

This chapter will demonstrate how to:

- Describe characteristics of helpful code comments

## The goal of a code comments

## Characteristics of clarifying code comments
  
Most users will probably not look at your code directly -- those who do are probably: 
Quite desperately troubleshooting something and were not able to find answers elsewhere.
Are “power users” who are already pretty invested in your tool and want to get more out of it -- may be helpful contributors too!

## Good examples of code comments


## Exercise: Create your own How-to examples!

TODO: Update instructions here. 

Use [the template reference guide template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jhudsl/itcr-template-documentation/master/docs/how-to_examples_template.md) to start your own reference guide either by using the markdown template directly, or navigating to the MkDocs repository you set up in the previous chapter. 

Keep in mind that if your tool's destination is Bioconductor or Galaxy, you should see our specific guidance on those repositories' examples.
