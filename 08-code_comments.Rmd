# Creating clarifying code comments

Describe characteristics of helpful code comments."/>

## The goal of a code documentation

Code documentation goes beyond your user.
It's a part of writing good code and helps your collaborators and future you!

Most users will probably not look at your code directly -- those who do are probably:

- Quite desperately troubleshooting something and were not able to find answers elsewhere.
- Are “power users” who are already pretty invested in your tool and want to get more out of it -- may be helpful contributors too!

Good code comments are a part of writing good code!
If you are the only person that knows what's happening in your code, you will be the only person who will be able to fix it when it breaks!
Your code is more likely to stand the test of time for longer if others can help you maintain it and want to use it because they can see what's happening enough to trust it themselves!
Working code is a start, but **readable** working code is best!
Code comments not only can clarify at points where your code might need further explanation but it can also help you think out your thought process and perhaps identify a better solution to the odd parts of your code.

## Characteristics of clarifying code comments

@Spertus lays out helpful "Rules" for writing helpful code comments [in this article](https://stackoverflow.blog/2021/07/05/best-practices-for-writing-code-comments/) which we recommend you read.

> Rule 1: Comments should not duplicate the code.

> Rule 2: Good comments do not excuse unclear code.

> Rule 3: If you can’t write a clear comment, there may be a problem with the code.

> Rule 4: Comments should dispel confusion, not cause it.

> Rule 5: Explain unidiomatic code in comments.

> Rule 6: Provide links to the original source of copied code.

> Rule 7: Include links to external references where they will be most helpful.

> Rule 8: Add comments when fixing bugs.

> Rule 9: Use comments to mark incomplete implementations.

Here is more reading about good code comments that have plenty of great discussions about how to up your code comment game.

## Exercise: Evaluate your own code's comments

Take a look through some of your tool's code and its comments.
Are there places it could be clearer?
Take sometime to think about your coding process and how it could improve.
[Code review](https://simpleprogrammer.com/why-code-reviews-make-better-code-teams/) is also an excellent way to improve code clarity and quality [@Bodner2018]!
