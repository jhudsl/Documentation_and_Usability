<div id="thinking-about-user-centered-development" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> Thinking about user-centered development</h2>
<p>Creating tools that are easy to use starts with thinking about your user’s perspective.
In other words, user design is an exercise in applied empathy <span class="citation">(Matos et al. <a href="#ref-deMatos2013" role="doc-biblioref">2013</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>This is why a common saying in user design is “You are not your user”<span class="citation">(Alexakis, <a href="#ref-Alexakis2017" role="doc-biblioref">n.d.</a>)</span>.
Although it may be true that you may have a lot in common with your user, this saying is based in the idea that you should not assume your user knows what you know or thinks like you do.
For example, a warning message that may seem perfectly clear to you as a developer, may be a foreign language to your user.</p>
<p><img src="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1cd434bkLer_CJ04GzpsZwzeEA9gjc5Ho6QimiHPbyEg/export/png?id=1cd434bkLer_CJ04GzpsZwzeEA9gjc5Ho6QimiHPbyEg&amp;pageid=gcd0e3791ab_0_0" /><a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>As compared to yourself, your typical user may likely have a different:<br />
- Educational background.<br />
- Programming experience level.<br />
- Set of motivations for using your tool.</p>
<p>And most importantly <em>your user does not know your tool like you do</em>!
You have spent many, many hours developing this tool and its unrealistic and impractical for them to spend the same number of hours with your tool that you have.</p>
<p>Also keep in mind users are humans in a context.
Humans have demands in their life distracting them, or are otherwise been working a long day, and are tired/frustrated/distracted/frazzled/etc.
Making your tool as easy as possible to use increases the likelihood of your user continuing to stick with your tool and even becoming an advocate for your tool to their colleagues!</p>
<div id="generalities-about-bioinformatics-tool-users" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.2.1</span> Generalities about bioinformatics tool users</h3>
<p>On a general level, there are some characteristics we know about bioinformatic tool user communities [].</p>
<p>The typical user of bioinformatics tools are generally:<br />
- Highly educated in their specific research topic.<br />
- Skilled at picking up new information.<br />
- Unlikely to have much experience in programming; may be uncomfortable with using command line.
- If they do have experience programming, it’s likely been from informal and self-taught learning.<br />
- Like many professionals, likely to feel time pressure from deadlines.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise:</strong> Think about these questions in regards to the user community for your tool.
Write down what you know (or think you know) and try to identify any knowledge gaps you might have about your user community.</p>
<ul>
<li>Who is your user community?</li>
<li>What need of theirs is addressed by your tool?</li>
<li>What kinds of skills does your tool assume your user has (does your user community have those skills)?</li>
</ul>
<p>Keep the questions about your user community in mind and in a <a href="">later chapter</a>, we’ll go into more detail about conducting user research to address any knowledge gaps you may have about your user community.</p>
</div>

<div id="general-principles-about-user-friendliness" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.3</span> General principles about user-friendliness</h2>
<p>While finding out about your user community is critical, there’s also principles we can discuss that are common to all users/humans.</p>
<div id="humans-like-visuals" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">2.3.0.1</span> Humans like visuals</h4>
<p>Humans are drawn to intuitive visuals.
Visuals are efficient means of communication and help users absorb information better than long-winded paragraphs (though visuals need an accompanying explanation too).</p>
</div>
<div id="stay-away-from-jargon" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">2.3.0.2</span> Stay away from jargon</h4>
<p>What someone considers jargon is a very relative to their own experiences.<br />
Terms that may seem like common knowledge to you may be foreign to your user.
For example, even an abbreviation like <code>TSV</code> may not be something a user understands what it means.
Instead, spell out abbreviations the first time you mention them (e.g. tab separated values).
This doesn’t mean you have to have long winded explanations of every term, instead you can quickly link out to an article or website with information about a term you’ve used (e.g. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tab-separated_values">tab separated values file (TSV)</a>).
This has the benefit of saving you and your user’s time without making your explanations too long winded.</p>
</div>
<div id="navigability-make-help-easy-to-find" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">2.3.0.3</span> Navigability: Make help easy to find</h4>
<p>When your user has a question in mind, it can make their experience a lot more stress-free if they can find their answer with ease.
Its not always obvious to a user where you have put an answer to something, particularly if user is already frustrated; deep in the troubleshooting trenches!</p>
<p>For these reasons, navigability is important for your tool and documentation.</p>
<p>Increasing your tools’ navigability:<br />
- Workshop an <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-interfaces/0596008031/ch04.html">intuitive layout</a>.<br />
- Minimize the number of clicks for finding help! – The more important a piece of information is to a users’ ability to use your tool, the more it should be in the forefront of your tool!<br />
- Be consistent about where to find things. Once a user has caught on to your pattern of how you store things in your tool, don’t switch it – patterns are super helpful!</p>
</div>
<div id="provide-a-method-for-users-to-file-concerns" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">2.3.0.4</span> Provide a method for users to file concerns</h4>
<p>No matter how much you have perfected your tool, it will never be perfect, especially since software deprecates over time.
Because of this or other unknown unknowns, a usable tool still has a way for a user to let the developers know when something isn’t working.
This might a direct and obvious break like a bug or broken link, but it could also be something more subtle that also requires your attention.</p>
<p>It may sound disappointing that a user has found a problem but this is something to be happy about!</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>This means someone is interested and invested in using your tool!<br />
</li>
<li>They’ve identified a way to improve your tool to make it even better!</li>
</ol>
<p>Providing a method of contact to your users doesn’t mean you need to give users your personal email.
In fact, that is probably not the most practical way to keep user queries organized.</p>
<p><em>Example contact methods</em>:<br />
- Have a link to a form for users to submit.<br />
- Direct users to file a GitHub issue.<br />
- Have a separate email inbox that you have a notification set up for.
- Have a Slack channel that you direct users to.</p>
<p>Now that we’ve discussed some major principles about users and design, let’s dive in to talking about how documentation can help!</p>
