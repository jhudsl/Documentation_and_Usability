In this chapter, we will discuss these other features, when you might want to consider adding them to your set of documentation. 10.2 FAQs As your user base grows and you start to get recurring questions, you may want to try to head off future users asking the same questions by incorporating clarifications into your documentation. Ideally you would make sure the most frequently asked questions would be addressed in the getting started section or perhaps your how-to examples. But, there may be other recurring questions that you don’t have a logical place to put the answers but it would be helpful for users to have the answers written somewhere. In this instance, a FAQ page may be what you need. 10.3 Cheatsheets If your tool has a lot of items that are handy but tough keep track of a cheatsheet may be especially helpful for your users. For inspiration and examples of nice cheatsheets, take a look through RStudio’s cheatsheets If you use Overleaf, there are template cheatsheets you can use here. 10.4 Videos If your tool uses a graphics user interface, sometimes videos can be the best way to demonstrate how-to examples. https://www.techsmith.com/blog/instructional-videos/ https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/introduction/ 10.5 Forums If your tool grows a big user base and your team has trouble keeping up with inquiries, you may benefit from creating a forum where your team can answer questions, but also users can answer each other’s questions in a way that’s searchable for other users. If you don’t have the resources to host your own forum, a Slack channel could serve similar purposes. 10.6 Exercise: Determine which (if any) of these features would work well for your tool "]
