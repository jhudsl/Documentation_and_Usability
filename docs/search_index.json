Tina the Tool developer, perhaps like you, has just gotten her product to the point that it works and many of the bugs have been sorted out. Tina’s awesome tool is working exactly as designed and Tina is excited to get her tool out there to be used by the community! 1 This is indeed cause for celebration! And perhaps researchers like Uri the Tool User will come across Tina’s awesome tool and share in Tina’s enthusiasm for the project! The informatics tool may be just what they were needing for their research project! Uri the Tool User can’t wait to apply Tina’s awesome tool to their project! But, it may not be long before Uri encounters errors, or questions about Tina’s awesome tool, no matter how well-crafted Tina has programmed it. Often users like Uri, particularly in the biology and cancer fields, have little to no programming experience. Even if a user does have programming experience, they are still unfamiliar with how Tina has set up tool. The tool may even be working exactly according to Tina’s vision but if users like Uri do not understand Tina’s vision or basic programming principles that Tina might take for granted, it can lead to a lot of frustration and time inefficiently spent. If the the tool’s documentation is non-existant, scarce, out-of-date, or filled with too much jargon, the chances that Uri the user will be able to successfully and efficiently create a product from the tool is slim to none. Lack of usability often leads users to ditch even the most well-crafted tools. This is the unfortunate and all-too-common result of many bioinformatics tools. 2.2.1 Bioinformatics and usability The lack of focus and education on usability in the informatics tool development is not only a disservice to progress of cancer research, but also to the tool developers themselves who have equally spent uncountable work hours and effort on the development of cancer tools. So why is poor documentation and usability common in bioinformatics? User designers in the field of bioinformatics have commented on reasons why this is: Problem 1) Tools developed in academia are often left to deprecate after publication because novelty is often prioritized over long-term maintenance and usability []. Problem 2) Bioinformatics tools have a very small and specialized user communities that are often overbooked and not incentivized to give feedback []. Problem 3) Lack of resources/education about usability specific to bioinformatics tool developing communities []. Unfortunately this specific course cannot address issues 1 and 2, but will attempt to help with problem 3. 2.2.2 Why documentation is worth the time Returning to Tina and Uri, 2.3 Subtopic For all cartoons:\nAvataars by https://getavataaars.com/.\nIcons by https://thenounproject.com/ License CC BY-NC-ND 2.0.\nEmojis by OpenMoji License: CC BY-SA 4.0.↩︎ "]
