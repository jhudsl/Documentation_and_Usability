A user will likely have a specific question about a function, parameter, data type, or option and will want to be able to navigate to information about that item. - The listed items are searchable or at least easily able to be visually scanned. - All items are described in clear, non-jargon, language. 2.2.5 Code comments Comments in your source code are also a part of documentation! In most instances, if your tools is functioning fine, code will probably only be looked at by advanced and/or the most invested users. But also recall that documentation is not only for your user but for future you and potential collaborator. 2.3 Documentation templates! We encourage you to create these pieces of documentation we will further discuss in the rest of this course! We have a folder of template markdown files that you can use as-is in your GitHub repository or have them rendered nicely as a read-the-docs site. Before we get into getting how to use these templates, we’ll give you a quick preview of this folder’s contents and upcoming chapters. templates ├── well_documented_checklist.md ├── getting_started_template.md ├── how_to_examples_examples.md └── reference_guide_template.md 2.3.1 Well-documented checklist This document has a checklist that summarizes the major aspects that should be included in a tools’ documentation. You can use it to evaluate your documentation for an existing tool, or as a to-do list that you can check off as you follow along with this course. 2.4 How to use the templates folder Option 1) Option 2) For all cartoons:\nAvataars by https://getavataaars.com/.\nIcons by https://thenounproject.com/ License CC BY-NC-ND 2.0.\nEmojis by OpenMoji License: CC BY-SA 4.0.↩︎ "]
