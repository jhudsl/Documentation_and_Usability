It’s a part of writing good code and helps your collaborators and future you! Most users will probably not look at your code directly – those who do are probably: Quite desperately troubleshooting something and were not able to find answers elsewhere. Are “power users” who are already pretty invested in your tool and want to get more out of it – may be helpful contributors too! 8.2 Characteristics of clarifying code comments Plenty of people have discussed good code comments at length so we’ll refer to those discussions here: What Makes a Good Code Comment? by Cronin (2019). The Value of Code Documentation by Meza (2018). Some internet wisdom on R documentation by Frazee (2014). How to Comment Your Code Like a Pro: Best Practices and Good Habits by Keeto (2019). Some major points from these articles: 8.3 Exercise: Evaluate your own code’s comments Take a look through some of your tool’s code and its comments. Are there places it could be clearer?
