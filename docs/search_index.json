Your user will have something in mind that they are trying to find information on – the quicker they can find it, the quicker their question can be answered. Our goal for a reference guide is to be as comprehensive, navigable, and as always clear as possible. 7.3 Characteristics of handy reference guides 7.3.1 Is easy to find As with our other documentation sections, no matter how well they are crafted, they are no use if no one can find them. 7.3.2 Data formats are described Perhaps after installation, getting data formatted correctly is one of the other very large hurdles users will need to deal with. Ideally, your tool can use a data format that is common. But the more that your tool is particular about an odd data format, the more your documentation needs to be specific about what the odd data format looks like. Including example files are helpful Send your user to any tools they can use to convert their data format 7.3.3 Is searchable Reference gudies being alphabetical is a start. If you are able to make terms searchable that’s even better, but at the very least, if your reference guide is visually easily able to be scanned, that can serve a similar function. 7.3.4 Is comprehensive All items are covered in the reference guide – every single thing. This includes all: terms functions arguments parameters defaults datasets or items included in the package buttons (in the case of a GUI) 7.3.5 All items are described in clear language 7.3.6 Entries should have a consistent format To recap: 7.4 Good examples of reference guides QIIME2 a great reference guide! Bolyen et al. (2019) cover all items and terms with lots of links to more information or related entries. Bioconductor packages have a consistent format which makes it easier for users to find once they are familiar with the format. A typical entry https://bioconductor.org/packages/3.12/bioc/html/GenomicRanges.html GSEA has great descriptions of their data formats 7.5 Exercise: Create your own reference guide! TODO: Update instructions here. Use the template reference guide template to start your own reference guide either by using the markdown template directly, or navigating to the MkDocs repository you set up in the previous chapter. Keep in mind that if your tool’s destination is Bioconductor or Galaxy, you should see our specific guidance on those repositories’ examples. References "]
