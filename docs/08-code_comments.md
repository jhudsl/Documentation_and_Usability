# Creating clarifying code comments

## The goal of a code documentation

Code documentation goes beyond your user.
It's a part of writing good code and helps your collaborators and future you!

Most users will probably not look at your code directly -- those who do are probably:

- Quite desperately troubleshooting something and were not able to find answers elsewhere.
- Are “power users” who are already pretty invested in your tool and want to get more out of it -- may be helpful contributors too!

## Characteristics of clarifying code comments

Plenty of people have discussed good code comments at length so we'll refer to those discussions here:

- [What Makes a Good Code Comment?](https://itnext.io/what-makes-a-good-code-comment-5267debd2c24) by @Cronin2019.  
- [The Value of Code Documentation](https://www.olioapps.com/blog/the-value-of-code-documentation/) by @Meza2018.  
- [Some internet wisdom on R documentation](http://alyssafrazee.com/2014/04/20/rdocs.html) by @Frazee2014.  
- [How to Comment Your Code Like a Pro: Best Practices and Good Habits](https://www.elegantthemes.com/blog/wordpress/how-to-comment-your-code-like-a-pro-best-practices-and-good-habits) by @Keeton2019.  

**Some major points from these articles:**

## Exercise: Evaluate your own code's comments

Take a look through some of your tool's code and its comments. 
Are there places it could be clearer?
Take sometime to think about your coding process and how it could improve. 
[Code review](https://simpleprogrammer.com/why-code-reviews-make-better-code-teams/) is also an excellent way to improve code clarity and quality!
