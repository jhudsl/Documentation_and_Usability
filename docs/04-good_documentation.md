### The 'Why' <img src="resources/images/why.png" width="8%">

The first thing that should be obvious to your user is why they should want to use your tool. 

### Getting started <img src="resources/images/getting-started.png" width="8%">

A Getting Started section will tell a new user the exact steps they need to:   
- Install the tool and any of its dependencies.     
- Run the most basic analysis with the tool.  
- Will link out to next steps for the user, like the How-to examples.    

### How-to examples <img src="resources/images/how-to.png" width="8%">

A set of How-to examples will demonstrate step-by-step the most common uses after they have completed the Getting Started steps. 
- Every step is specifically provided.  
- Any data needed to run the data is provided.  
- Common pitfalls and nuances of the tool are explained in the context of the examples.  

### Reference guides <img src="resources/images/ref-guide.png" width="8%">

A reference guide is like a dictionary that a user can reference as questions arise. 
A user will likely have a specific question about a function, parameter, data type, or option and will want to be able to navigate to information about that item.
- The listed items are searchable or at least easily able to be visually scanned.    
- All items are described in clear, non-jargon, language.  

### Code comments <img src="resources/images/comment.png" width="8%">

Comments in your source code are also a part of documentation!
In most instances, if your tools is functioning fine, code will probably only be looked at by advanced and/or the most invested users. 
But also recall that documentation is not only for your user but for future you and potential collaborator.

## Documentation templates!

We encourage you to create these pieces of documentation we will further discuss in the rest of this course!

We have [a folder of template markdown files]() that you can use as-is in your GitHub repository or have them rendered nicely as a [read-the-docs site]().
Before we get into getting how to use these templates, we'll give you a quick preview of this folder's contents and upcoming chapters. 

```
templates
├── well_documented_checklist.md
├── getting_started_template.md
├── how_to_examples_examples.md
└── reference_guide_template.md
```

### Well-documented checklist

This document has a checklist that summarizes the major aspects that should be included in a tools' documentation. 
You can use it to evaluate your documentation for an existing tool, or as a to-do list that you can check off as you follow along with this course.
