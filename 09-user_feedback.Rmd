# Obtaining user feedback

## Learning Objectives

This chapter will demonstrate how to:

- Understand the goals of obtaining user feedback. 
- Construct user feedback methods that inform work on your tool. 
- Create a plan for how to obtain user feedback for your tool. 

## The goal of user feedback

How do you know if your code is working? You test it and get feedback! 
Similarly, how do you know if your tool is working for your user? Ask them for feedback!


## Characteristics of informative user feedback

## Methods of user feedback

At the most basic level, you need to provide your users a way to alert you if something with your tool is not working appropriately. 

It may sound disappointing that a user has found a problem but this is something to be happy about!  
1) This means someone is interested and invested in using your tool!   
2) They've identified a way to improve your tool to make it even better!  

Providing a method of contact to your users doesn't mean you need to give users your personal email. 
In fact, that is probably not the most practical way to keep user queries organized. 

_Example contact method ideas_: 

- Have a link to a form for users to submit.   
- Direct users to file a [GitHub issue](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/about-issues).    
- Have a separate email inbox that you have a notification set up for.  
- Have a [Slack channel](https://slack.com/) that you direct users to.  

Whatever method of contact you provide your users, just make sure its something that works for you and your team to respond to!

## Case studies of user research

## Exercise: Create a plan for user feedback for your tool

TODO: Update instructions here. 

We have a mock feedback user form set up here. 
This form shouldn't be used as is, but could be tailored to more specifically ask questions about your tool that you are looking to get information about.
